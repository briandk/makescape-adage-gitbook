# Analyzing Oztoc Data: An ADAGE Case Study

In this book, we explain and analyze some actual play data collected from our MakeScape project. The book is divided into a few sections:

- **What is Oztoc** explains the project itself
- **Tools We Use** gives an overview of the open-source software we use to create our analyses
- **Data Analysis** is where we showcase the gritty work of understanding our playtest data
