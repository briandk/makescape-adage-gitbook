# Resources and Further Reading

### If You're New To Programming and Python

It's hard to do better than Mark Pilgrim's _Dive Into Python_. The book is freely available to read on the web, but you can also purchase a hard copy through major retailers like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430224150?ie=UTF8&tag=diveintomark-20&creativeASIN=1430224150).

Note that Python still maintains two major versions: 2.x and 3.x, and there are different versions of the book for each:

- [Dive Into Python 2](http://www.diveintopython.net)
- [Dive Into Python 3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/)

### If You're New To Pandas and/or iPython Notebook

You might do well to watch this 10-minute overview by Wes McKinney, the originator of Pandas. The video isn't comprehensive, but it will give you a taste of some common operations in Pandas

Pandas also has fairly excellent documentation, including these [tutorials for first-time users](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html). I would particularly recommend the [Lessons For New Pandas Users](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html#lessons-for-new-pandas-users)

### If You Want To Learn More About The Grammar of Graphics

I would highly recommend [Hadley Wickham's book](http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403). The pricetag is steep, though, so if possible, check whether your local library has it.
