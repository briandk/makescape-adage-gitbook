# What is Oztoc?

Oztoc is an interactive game developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Students use physical blocks to construct virtual circuits that lure bioluminescent fish from the deep.

# What kinds of data do we collect?

Using the [ADAGE](http://adageapi.org/) framework, we're able to log discrete events as they happen in the game. In this test case analysis, we'll mainly be concerned with with events that happen when players connect and disconnect circuit components.
