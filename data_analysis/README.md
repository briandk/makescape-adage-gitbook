# Data Analysis

Here, we'll describe how we analyze the data. What you'll see are actual code snippets, like this:

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

And, where appropriate, the output that follows:

*Hello, World!*

### Get The Data and Follow Along

Everything you see was based on the analysis in my iPython Notebook: 

<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cpl-uw/adage-gitbook-data/blob/master/2014-05-13%20makescape%20playtest%20data.ipynb>

And, the notebook itself and the dataset are available to download right now on Github so you can follow along:

Let's get going and start analyzing!
