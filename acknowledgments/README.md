# Acknowledgments

I couldn't have done this without assistance. Allison Salmon and Isaac Goodin at the Learning Games Network were instrumental in helping me get data when I needed it. Bryce Nyeggen helped me think through kernel density estimates. And Hadley Wickham wrote the book that got me started down this entire path in the first place.

A special thanks goes to Caitlin Rivers ([@cmyeaton](https://twitter.com/cmyeaton)) for encouraging me and helping me get started with Pandas in the first place.
